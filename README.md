# WEB-PROGRAMMING-2023-FINALS-PROJECT

## PROJECT:
The project is an online marketplace website created using React, MySQL and Node.js.

Data is pulled from database and shown on page. Data is broken down into two tables "listings" and "users".The user specific and all users pages are locked behind authentication.

Users can create listings and see their own listings. The project consists of "Listings", "My Listings", "New Listing", "All Users" and "Login" / "Singup" pages. The "Listings" page shows all listings that exist in the database. The "My Listings" page shows user made listings via user id/listing items' seller id. "New Listings" is a page with a few input fields and a button that once filled allow a user to create a new listing. "All Users" was intended as an admin only feature, but frankly I've given up on that so now there's a page that allows anyone to see all the users that exist in the database. The "Login" / "Logout" page are for account authorization and creation.
