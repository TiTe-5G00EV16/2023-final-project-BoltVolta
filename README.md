# WEB-PROGRAMMING-2023-FINALS-PROJECT

## PROJECT:
This is a web page project containing the backend, the database and the frontend code. The project consists of "Listings", "My Listings", "New Listing", "All Users" and "Login" / "Singup" pages. The "Listings" page shows all listings that exist in the database. The "My Listings" page shows user made listings via user id/listing items' seller id. "New Listings" is a page with a few input fields and a button that once filled allow a user to create a new listing. "All Users" was intended as an admin only feature, but frankly I've given up on that so now there's a page that allows anyone to see all the users that exist in the database. The "Login" / "Logout" page are for accoutn authorization and creation.
